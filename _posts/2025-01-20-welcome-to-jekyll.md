# Welcome!

This is my first post on my new blog powered by Jekyll and the Chirpy theme.

## Features

The Chirpy theme offers many great features:

- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on all devices
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Perfect for code snippets
- **Search**: Built-in search functionality
- **TOC**: Table of contents for easy navigation

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

hello_world()
```

## What's Next?

I'll be posting more content soon about various technical topics. Stay tuned!
